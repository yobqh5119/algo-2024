# Solution
  - The approach to this problem is pretty simple, we need to have two variables to compare against `currentAltitude` and `maxAltitude`
    - `currentAltitude` will be calculated by just adding the each gain numbers `gain[i]`, and it will start with an altitude of `0`

# Big O
  - Space will be O(1)
  - Time will be O(n)
